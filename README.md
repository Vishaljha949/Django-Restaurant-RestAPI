# Restaurant REST API

This is a RESTful API for managing restaurant operations, built with Django and Django REST Framework. The API allows for efficient handling of restaurant data, including menu items, orders, customers, and staff management.

## Features

- **Menu Management**: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for restaurant menu items, including categories, pricing, and availability.
- **Order Management**: Handle customer orders, including creating new orders, updating order status, and tracking order history.
- **Customer Management**: Manage customer data, including registration, authentication, and order history.
- **Staff Management**: Manage restaurant staff, including roles, permissions, and shift schedules.
- **Table Reservations**: Implement table booking functionality with available slots and booking history.
- **User Authentication**: Secure API endpoints with token-based authentication and user roles (e.g., admin, customer, staff).
- **Search and Filter**: Advanced search and filtering options for menu items and orders.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Django REST Framework**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment and scalability.
